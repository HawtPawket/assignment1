# Task 1: Validating Calculations: Calculate the value of a particular arithmetic 
# expression twice: once normally, and once using parentheses. 
# Compare the two results to see if they match.

# Task 2: Mix and Match: Combine arithmetic (+), logical (or), and comparison (>) 
# operators in a single expression and predict the outcome. Then, compute the
#  expression to see if the prediction was correct.
