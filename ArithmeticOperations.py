# Task 1: Grocery Store Math:  Calculate the total cost of three items
# you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. 
# For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? 
# Prices don't need to be realistic


steak = 18.99
potatoes = 4.99
salad = 6.99

print(steak+potatoes+salad)





# Task 2: Bank Interest: If you have a savings account with a particular initial
# amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. 
# So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. 
# For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

amount = 20000
interest = .07
year= 1

print(interest*amount*year+amount)
